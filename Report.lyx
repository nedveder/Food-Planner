\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This project addresses the critical challenge of optimizing food inventory
 management in kitchens through AI-driven planning techniques.
 Our goal is to minimizing food waste while creating a flexible platform
 to maximize personal tase, preparation time and shelf time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Food waste is a pressing global issue, with up to 40% of food in the United
 States going uneaten.
 A significant portion of this waste occurs in homes and restaurants, largely
 due to ineffective inventory management and meal planning.
 By developing an intelligent system that optimizes ingredient usage, we
 aim to reduce waste, save costs, and lessen the environmental impact of
 food disposal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To navigate the complex decision-making involved in meal preparation and
 inventory management, we model the problem as a state space search, where
 each state reflects the current inventory and meal plan.
 Actions, in this context, are recipe selections that transform the state
 by consuming ingredients and adding meals to the plan.
 The goal is to find a sequence of actions that optimizes meal planning
 based on our evaluation criteria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To solve this optimization problem, we implement and compare several algorithms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Greedy Algorithm: Select the best immediate action at each step.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Simulated Annealing: Iteratively refines a random solution to improve performanc
e.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Reinforcement Learning: Learns an optimal policy through repeated interactions
 with the environment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially we planed on using GRAPHPLAN algorithm as well for solving this,
 but due to time constraints, and the size of datasets after a number of
 trials we decided to remove it (we were not able to properly test it since
 every run took a very long time).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By exploring these diverse techniques, we aim to identify the most effective
 method for optimizing food inventory usage.
 To ensure usability, we’ve developed a user-friendly graphical interface
 using Python's Tkinter library.
 Key components of the interface include: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Home frame providing an overview and instructions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An Upload frame for managing product and inventory data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Settings frame for configuring optimization parameters and selecting solvers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A Results frame displaying optimized meal plans, scores, and solver execution
 times.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This intuitive GUI enables users to interact with the AI system without
 requiring technical knowledge.
 Furthermore, our system’s flexible architecture allows for future enhancements,
 such as incorporating nutritional balance and dietary restriction constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During this project we have used a number of LLM's for different use cases,
 Perplexity for finding previous work done in similar topics, and Claude
 for assistance with generating initial test data, edits to the report and
 solving bugs in the code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Previous Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several algorithms and approaches have been used to tackle the challenge
 of optimizing food inventory usage and meal planning.
 Linear programming has emerged as a particularly useful technique for solving
 these types of optimization problems.
 Linear programming was first applied to diet optimization in the 1940s
 by economist George Stigler, who tried to determine the minimum cost diet
 that would meet basic nutritional requirements 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "https://doi.org/10.1111/nbu.12076"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While Stigler was unable to find an exact solution due to the complexity
 of the problem, mathematician George Dantzig later developed the simplex
 algorithm that made solving such linear programming problems feasible 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "https://doi.org/10.1111/nbu.12076"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 More recently, researchers have applied linear programming to develop nutrition
ally adequate, low-cost meal plans.
 For example, the USDA has used diet modeling since 1975 to generate balanced,
 affordable menus in its Thrifty Food Plan
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "https://doi.org/10.1111/nbu.12076"

\end_inset

.
 Linear programming has also been used to design school lunch menus that
 reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water use

\begin_layout Standard
These are classical algorithms that solve CSP's, but mostly lack the flexibility
 to expand the problem and allow different metrics to be added easily.
\end_layout

We are interested mainly in Minimizing food waste although using our algorithms
 it would be easy to optimize for all three benchmarks given the data for
 food items and recipes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next section we discuss our assumptions made in order to model the
 problem in a way to gives us much flexibility, for both removing self imposed
 constraints, and relieving assumptions made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We modeled our problem using our current 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

State
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the given food items we can use, their quantities, their expiry date
 and our current date.
 And a set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Actions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 defined by recipes, where we track the food items needed, the cooking time,
 the nutritional value and a rather subjective measure of tastefulness.
 This structure allows great flexibility both in adding fields to each food
 item (CO2 emmisions per gram etc.) and to recipes (analysis of nutritional
 values for making custom diets).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Algorithms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used four different algorithms to solve the problem, each algorithm takes
 a different approach to find an optimal solution, starting with a naive
 greedy solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Greedy Solver
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Greedy Solver makes the best choice at each step without looking ahead.
 It works in the following manner:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Checks available actions (meals that can be made with current ingredients)
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Picks the action with the highest score 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Updates the state and repeats until the goal is reached or no more actions
 are possible
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reinforcement Learning Solver
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This solver learns from repeated attempts to solve the problem.
 It uses Q-learning, a model free RL algorithm.
 The process includes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Randomly trying different actions and observing outcomes 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Updating a "Q-table" that stores the expected value of each action in each
 state 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Balancing exploration of new options with using known good choices (epsilon
 greedy)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Simulated Annealing Solver
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A method used for solving CSP's, and is a take of the hill climber algorithm,
 This solver:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Starts with a random solution 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Makes small changes to the solution 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Accepts improvements always and worse solutions sometimes, based on a "temperatu
re" that decreases over time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Assumptions and Success Criteria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our algorithms are general solvers for the problem setup, thus we have created
 a number of different optimization goals for the general solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
All solvers work towards two main goals:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Minimize waste by using ingredients before they expire 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Maximize or minimize chosen parameters: Shelf time, Taste rating, Number
 of steps, Preparation time and Number of products
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Our system makes the following key assumptions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We have accurate data on ingredient expiration dates and nutritional values,
 without expiration date the model is useless since this is our main objective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Meal preparation time is not a constraint - it can be used as a parameter
 for optimizing upon, but is not defined in a way that we won't or will
 choose a recipe due to preparation time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We do not take into account shelf life for future planning of meals, meaning
 if a recipe has a shelf life of two weeks or one day won't change the meals
 chosen into the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reward functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our project uses three problem setups as the infrastructure for solving
 our objectives, each problem setup is created with a different reward function.
 All problems have a final score which is the total sum of all action scores
 chosen along the way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
CountExpiredItemsProblem: This function scores meals based on the number
 of items that would expire if not used:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{score} & = & \frac{1}{\text{expired count}+1}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where expired count is the number of items that would expire by the next
 day if not used in the current meal.
 This is the most accurate metric for our problem definition, but as we
 can see, it is discrete in nature.
 There is no true relation between the number of expired items for one action
 on day 1 to the number of expired items per action for day 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
MinimizeWasteProblem: This problem scores meals based on how soon their
 ingredients will expire.
 It calculates for each action the sum over each ingredient:
\size footnotesize

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{score} & =\frac{1}{\text{expired count}+1}+ & \sum\frac{1}{\text{expiration date}-\text{current date}+1}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\size default
The main goal of this problem setup is to solve the issue with the previous
 setup, and give a sense of continuity to choices of actions over time.
 This problem can be thought of as a heuristic for the first problem, and
 we shall see why.
 We note that since a legal action is a recipe where all ingredients exist
 and are not expired the denominator is always positive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ParametersProblem: This problem scores according to recipes parameters,
 trying to maximize or minimize chosen fields, this problem combined with
 MinimizeWasteProblem gives us a general problem that plays on the tradeoff
 between our parameters and the waste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Claim
The MinimizeWasteProblem heuristic serves as an admissible heuristic for
 CountExpiredItemsProblem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Since we are trying to minimize the cost in this problem, for admissibility
 we must show MinimizeWasteProblem is larger than CountExpiredItemsProblem
 for every action and state.
 But by definition it is defined as a sum of CountExpiredItemsProblem score,
 and a positive value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For evaluation we made a number of datasets of both products and recipes,
 ranging in sizes, parameters and dates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our experiments evaluated three algorithms—Greedy, Simulated Annealing,
 and Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning)—across different meal planning
 scenarios.
 We tested these algorithms on three problem types: MinimizeWasteProblem,
 CountExpiredItemsProblem, and ParametersProblem.
 Our key metrics were waste reduction, solution quality, and execution time.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Algorithm Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Greedy Algorithm Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Greedy algorithm excelled in speed but often failed to produce complete
 meal plans.
 Its strategy of making locally optimal choices led to situations where
 it ran out of ingredients before completing the required number of meals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As seen in
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, the Greedy algorithm consistently had the shortest execution times across
 all problem types.
 However, its speed came at a cost to solution quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Simulated Annealing Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulated Annealing emerged as the most effective algorithm in our tests.
 It achieved the highest scores in most scenarios and solved almost every
 meal planning problem we presented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 illustrates Simulated Annealing's superior performance in terms of solution
 quality.
 It consistently outscored the other algorithms across all problem types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulated Annealing showed particular strength in the MinimizeWasteProblem.
 We believe this is due to the nature of the problem's score function.
 The MinimizeWasteProblem likely has a smoother, more convex score landscape,
 allowing Simulated Annealing to behave similarly to gradient descent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reinforcement Learning Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning) algorithm showed potential but faced
 challenges.
 Its scores were comparable to Simulated Annealing in many cases, demonstrating
 its ability to find good solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, Reinforcement Learning had two significant drawbacks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Long execution times: As seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, Reinforcement Learning consistently took much longer to run than the other
 algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Sensitivity to hyperparameters: The algorithm's performance varied greatly
 depending on its hyperparameter settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To address the hyperparameter challenge, we conducted a grid search to find
 optimal settings.
 The following table shows the top-performing configurations for MinimizeWastePr
oblem and CountExpiredItemsProblem, respectively.

 This highlights the challenge of using Reinforcement Learning in practice,
 as it requires tuning for each specific problem.

 we can see the results of each of the algorithms on different datasets
 with different parameters (Start time, number of meals etc.).
 Simulated Annealing clusters near the top-right corner, showing high and
 consistent performance across problem types.
 Reinforcement Learning shows more spread, indicating its performance varies
 more between problems, the algorithm showed more consistent performance
 across problem types compared to the Greedy algorithm, but still fell short
 of Simulated Annealing's results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Greedy algorithm performs similar to Simulated Annealing on problem
 layouts it was able to solve, but we can see the number of solutions is
 sparse, meaning it wasn't able to find a solution for many of the problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We wanted to check the ability of learning a policy using RL for a heuristic
 function, so we tried to analyze the ability of the RL solver to learn
 one problem i.e MinimizeWasteProblem, and use the policy gathered for CountExpir
edItemsProblem which is a more accurate depiction of our problem.

 shows how well the algorithm transfers between different problem types.
 Points closer to the diagonal line indicate better transfer, meaning the
 algorithm performs similarly on both problems, but as we can see

\begin_layout Subsection
Impact of Problem Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main factor affecting algorithm performance was whether a valid meal
 plan existed under the given constraints.
 When we increased the number of days or meals per day, we sometimes created
 scenarios where no valid solution existed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simulated Annealing proved most robust in these cases.
 It usually found a solution when one existed, and quickly identified when
 no solution was possible.
 The Greedy algorithm often failed in these more constrained scenarios,
 while Reinforcement Learning sometimes found solutions but took much longer
 to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Unexpected Findings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strong performance of Simulated Annealing was unexpected.
 Despite being a relatively simple algorithm, it outperformed the more complex
 Reinforcement Learning approach in both score and runtime across the number
 of iterations and datasets we tested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This result challenges the assumption that more complex algorithms always
 yield better results.
 It suggests that for this particular problem space, the balance of exploration
 and exploitation in Simulated Annealing is particularly effective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Trade-offs Between Execution Time and Solution Quality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our results clearly show the trade-offs between execution time and solution
 quality:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Greedy algorithm offers the fastest execution but often fails to find
 valid solutions, especially in more constrained scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Simulated Annealing provides an excellent balance, offering near-optimal
 solutions with execution times close to the Greedy algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reinforcement Learning can find high-quality solutions but at the cost of
 much longer execution times and the need for careful hyperparameter tuning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These trade-offs highlight the importance of choosing the right algorithm
 based on the specific needs of a meal planning scenario.
 In time-sensitive situations where a good (but not necessarily optimal)
 solution is needed quickly, Simulated Annealing appears to be the best
 choice.
 For scenarios where computation time is less constrained and finding the
 absolute best solution is critical, Reinforcement Learning might be worth
 considering, provided sufficient time is allocated for hyperparameter tuning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Practical Implications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These results have several practical implications for meal planning systems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Simulated Annealing emerges as a strong default choice for most meal planning
 scenarios.
 Its consistent performance and reasonable execution times make it suitable
 for a wide range of applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Greedy algorithm, while fast, should be used cautiously.
 It might be suitable for very simple scenarios or as a quick first pass
 to generate a baseline solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reinforcement Learning, while powerful, requires careful consideration before
 deployment.
 Its long execution times and sensitivity to hyperparameters make it more
 suitable for offline optimization or scenarios where extensive computation
 resources are available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The choice of algorithm should consider the specific problem type.
 For example, Simulated Annealing's particular short runtime suggests it
 would be better for very large datasets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Robust meal planning systems should incorporate multiple algorithms.
 Using Simulated Annealing as a primary solver with a RLHF algorithm for
 creating personalized recipes and meal plans would make for a great platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our project tackled the challenge of optimizing food inventory management
 in kitchens using AI-driven planning techniques.
 We aimed to minimize food waste while considering factors like personal
 taste, preparation time, and shelf life.
 We modeled the problem as a state space search.
 Each state represented the current inventory and meal plan, while actions
 were recipe selections that transformed the state by using ingredients
 and adding meals to the plan.
 Our goal was to find a sequence of actions that optimized meal planning
 based on our evaluation criteria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We implemented and compared three algorithms: Greedy, Simulated Annealing,
 and Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning).
 Each algorithm approached the problem differently, offering unique trade-offs
 between solution quality and execution time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our results revealed several key findings:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Simulated Annealing emerged as the most effective algorithm overall.
 It consistently achieved the highest scores across various scenarios and
 problem types, while maintaining reasonable execution times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Greedy algorithm was the fastest but often failed to produce complete
 meal plans, especially in more constrained scenarios.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reinforcement Learning showed potential in finding high-quality solutions
 but suffered from long execution times and high sensitivity to hyperparameter
 settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Performance varied across problem types (MinimizeWasteProblem, CountExpiredItems
Problem, and ParametersProblem), with Simulated Annealing showing particular
 strength in the MinimizeWasteProblem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The main factor affecting algorithm performance was whether a valid meal
 plan existed under the given constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These findings have practical implications for meal planning systems.
 Simulated Annealing stands out as a strong default choice for most scenarios,
 while the Greedy algorithm might serve as a quick baseline or fallback
 option.
 Reinforcement Learning, despite its potential, requires careful consideration
 due to its computational demands and sensitivity to hyperparameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Critiquing our work, we acknowledge several limitations and areas for improvemen
t:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Assumptions: Our model assumes accurate data on ingredient expiration dates
 and nutritional values.
 In reality, this data might be imperfect or missing, which could significantly
 impact our results.
 Future work could explore robust optimization techniques to handle uncertain
 or incomplete data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Real world applications: While we tested our algorithms on various dataset
 sizes, we didn't fully explore their performance on very large, real-world
 scale problems.
 This is crucial for understanding how these algorithms would perform in
 commercial or industrial settings.
 Our current model doesn't account for new items being added to the inventory
 over time, which is a common occurrence in real kitchens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
User preferences: Our model considers taste as a parameter but doesn't account
 for individual user preferences or dietary restrictions.
 Incorporating these factors could make the system more personalized and
 practical for real-world use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Parameter optimization: While our system allows for optimization of nutritional
 parameters, we didn't deeply explore how well the generated meal plans
 meet comprehensive nutritional guidelines.
 This is an important aspect for any practical meal planning system.
 And although our system aims to reduce food waste, we didn't explicitly
 model or optimize for other environmental factors like greenhouse gas emissions
 associated with different ingredients or cooking methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we were to revoke certain assumptions, such as the accuracy of expiration
 dates or the static nature of the inventory, our algorithms would need
 significant modifications.
 For example, we might need to incorporate probabilistic models for food
 spoilage or implement dynamic programming approaches to handle changing
 inventories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other methods that could potentially solve this problem include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Genetic Algorithms: These could be useful for exploring a wider solution
 space and potentially finding novel meal combinations, these perform in
 similar manner to Simulated Annealing but allow for more complex policies
 to arise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Mixed Integer Programming: This could provide optimal solutions for smaller
 problem instances and serve as a benchmark for our heuristic approaches,
 in fact this is the main method used today, as seen in previous work section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Deep Reinforcement Learning: More advanced RL techniques might use an Actor-Crit
ic architecture to both determine best values for each recipe based upon
 personal taste and chosen parameters, and optimize the meal plan for that
 specific reward function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, our work provides a solid foundation for AI-driven meal planning
 systems aimed at reducing food waste.
 While Simulated Annealing emerged as the most effective approach in our
 tests, there's ample room for further research and refinement.
 Future work should focus on addressing the limitations we've identified
 and exploring additional optimization techniques to create more robust,
 flexible, and practical meal planning solutions.
